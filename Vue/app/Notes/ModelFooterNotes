Model Footer

Progress bar
    -> When a model is not running it shows progress through the inputs process.
        -> Need to keep track of what input pages are complete.
            -> Mark each page as complete or not.
            -> Function to check if a page is complete.
                -> this may require a backend function as well to check that the inputs are valid.

        -> Get number completed from back end.
            -> computed state should be enough. Only needs to be changed from the backend.

    -> When a model is running it shows progress through the modelling.
        -> More TBA.
