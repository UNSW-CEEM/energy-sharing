I’ve just pushed up a version that works :slightly_smiling_face:
If you look in the mike branch, I’ve put two files in the Flask folder
one is mike_params.json
that has all of the configuration parameters for running the model
Most of them will be either familiar to you, or obvious what they do
hit me up though if youre confused
the second file is mike_runner.py
thats the script that runs the program and spits out the output
if you want, you could nuke your current changes by typing git reset --hard
then git pull would bring down the new changes i made
then go into the Flask folder and run python mike_runner.py
should be all good :slightly_smiling_face:

Gawd bless ya Luke. Thanks! :grin:
Luke 10:23 AM
No problem at all :slightly_smiling_face: Hope it helps!

So i just need to read my .csv files into params dict and I'll  be away.... beautiful.
Luke 10:25 AM
Yep! They’ll need to live in the same folder as the other .csv files
and the participants will need associated profiles (column headings in those csvs)

Cool. By 'same folder' you mean modelling\data\mike with my old file structure (load_profiles, pv_profiles, reference, etc....) within it?
Luke 10:30 AM
No, actually, now for load and solar data it’s modelling\data\shared - \load or \solar
sharing is caring
forgot about that one
Mike 10:32 AM
sharing IS caring, Luke. :grin:
cool... and my reference files and 'study' files are in data\mike still...
Luke 10:32 AM
yeah, all the model-specific stuff is still in data\mike - just needed a common place to put the new-format load and solar files :slightly_smiling_face:
Mike 10:33 AM
'new format' - ah yes. Just the time format I need to change on my old load and pv data?
Luke 10:34 AM
I think so yes - its been so many iterations but Im 99% sure it was just the time format
